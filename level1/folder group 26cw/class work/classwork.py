#here we used snake_case to make the variable more readable
dog_name1 = "rick"
dog_name2 = "john"
dog_name2 = "max"
#here we gave a variable a name 

#but here we used f string that made our day easier because instead of using " " to get some space inbetween to words we just used the spacebar

print(f"first dogs name is {dog_name1} and second dogs name is {dog_name2}")

#so in total we used (snake_case and comments)
